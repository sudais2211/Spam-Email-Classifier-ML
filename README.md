# Spam-Email-Classifier-ML
A Machine Learning-based Spam Email Classifier using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It analyzes text data to detect spam or ham messages using NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Naive Bayes model.

Spam Email Classifier (ML Project)

A machine learning project that classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Scikit-learn.
This model was trained on the famous SMS Spam Collection Dataset and tested using TF-IDF + Naive Bayes.

 Features:

Cleans and preprocesses raw email text

Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trains and evaluates multiple ML models

Predicts unseen email messages as spam or ham

Simple and lightweight â€” perfect for beginners

Tech Stack:

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

ðŸ§© How It Works

Load and clean the dataset (spam.csv)

Preprocess text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Transform using TfidfVectorizer

Train with Multinomial Naive Bayes

Test with new email samples
